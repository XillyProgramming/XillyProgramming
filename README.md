- I've worked with neural networks and other machine learning techniques with Python.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Russian.
- 👀 The world is full of hypocrites.
- 🌱 I am kind and caring vegetarian, who tries her best to preserve the nature and ecology.
- 💞️ I love my family and my country. Is patriotism a crime? A man with no love for his country has no honor and can never truelly love.
- 📫 If you read this, you must have been really curious about me. Thank you!
